# Hittite corpus

This is a project for developing a corpus of Hittite clauses

Hittite is an Anatolian language of Indo-European family, the oldest Indo-European language attested in writing between 1800 and 1200 ВСЕ. It was spoken on the territory of modern Turkey, with the centre in Hattusa (modern-day Bogazkoy), in the II millennium BCE. The Hittite Empire represents one of the Great Kingdoms of the Late Bronze age, and thus functioned as a very influential force in the Ancient Near East of the II millennium BCE.
